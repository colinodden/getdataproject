Course Project: Getting and Cleaning Data
========================================
## Files in this project
## readme.md
* You're reading it!
## run_analysis.R
* The single R program file required to transform the source data into two outputs.
## codebook.md
* Describes of the operation of run_analysis.R on the source data
* Describes the contents of the output files.

# Caveats:
* Must be online to execute run_analysis.R - the program downloads data from a web site
* R must have write access in the working directory set by the user.

# References
I failed to collect references as I went along. I owe a debt of gratitude to the StackExchange R boards and to 
I also took a bit of clever code from http://rstudio-pubs-static.s3.amazonaws.com/13879_d921eeda39c44faca03b69ee64ded40f.html
